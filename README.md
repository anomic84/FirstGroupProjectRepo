### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

Right now the Brewmaster API, when given a city, searches and returns ALL cities. In the future we hope to add a way to narrow down to specific city in the state. We would also love to have the mapquest map show the correct name on the markers when the city searched, as of right now it just shows one name for each marker.
